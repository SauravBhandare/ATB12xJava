       /* Class:
        A class is a blueprint or template in object-oriented programming.
        It defines attributes (also called fields or properties) and behaviors
         (also called methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
        Example: A Car class may have attributes like color, brand, speed, and behaviors like drive() and brake().

         Object:
        An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has
        actual values for the attributes and can perform the defined behaviors.
        Example: Car myCar = new Car(); â€” myCar is an object of the Car class.*/
